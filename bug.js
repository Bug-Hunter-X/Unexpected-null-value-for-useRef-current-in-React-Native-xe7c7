This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a function component.  The `current` property of the ref might be unexpectedly `null` even after the component has mounted and rendered. This often happens when trying to access the ref within a callback function that's triggered after the component has rendered or during certain lifecycle events like `componentDidMount`.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Animated } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const animatedValue = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current; // Potential issue here
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (myRef.current) {
      // Accessing myRef.current here might still result in null
      console.log('Ref:', myRef.current);
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Animated.View ref={myRef} style={{transform: [{translateY: animatedValue}]}} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
