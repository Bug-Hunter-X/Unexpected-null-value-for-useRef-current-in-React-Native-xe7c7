The solution involves using useEffect hook to ensure the ref is accessed only after the component has mounted and rendered. This ensures that the `current` property has been populated.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Animated } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const animatedValue = useRef(new Animated.Value(0));
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Accessing myRef.current here is safe since the component has mounted
    if (myRef.current) {
      console.log('Ref:', myRef.current);
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Animated.View ref={myRef} style={{transform: [{translateY: animatedValue.current}]}} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

Key changes:

1. **`useRef` Initialization**: The `useRef` hook is now initialized without immediately accessing `.current`.
2. **`useEffect` Hook**: The ref is accessed within a `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array, ensuring it runs only after the component mounts.
3. **Null Check**: A null check (`if (myRef.current)`) is implemented to prevent errors if something goes wrong.
